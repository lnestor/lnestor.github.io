This update I want to turn this into a fully functioning game. This means I'll have a mechanism to start the dogfight and detect when it's over. Usually this would probably kick you back to a menu or something, but for now I'll just have the player press "R" or something to reset the dogfight.

# Ending the Game

There are two ways the game can end: the player dies or all AI enemies are killed. I'll need a component that manages this. Perhaps it could be the Arena component, but that already handles detecting when a plane strays too far, so I'll make a new component. Perhaps `EndGameManager` would be an appropriate name for it now. We'll see if it sticks with that name, I'm not sure if I need to include "beginning game" content inside it, but we can refactor.

The first thing I'll work on is detecting when the player has died. Every plane has a `Damageable` component that has an `OnDie` event. The purpose of this event was supposed to be localized to the player only, whereas events between objects are handled by the `EventManager`. To do this, I'll make a `PlayerDeath` component that will handle everything necessary when a player dies (like noises, particles, etc.). It will also notify the `EndGameManager` that the player has died.

After implementing that, I realized that I already had an event fire when a plane is destroyed. The current event was telling the Arena that a contestant has died, so we can just hook into that event. A bug that I ran across occurred when two bullets hit a plane the same frame when it got destroyed. Both of the bullets registered as killing the plane, so it would call the eent twice. In my `EndGameManager`, I was keeping a count of the number of planes still in the game, and every time this happened it would think that two planes were destroyed. So, the game would end twice as fast as it should. My first fix included keeping track of which planes were in the game and removing from that list when a plane was destroyed, similar to how we keep track of Contestants in the Arena. So, before the `EndGameManager` would decrement the number of planes still alive, it would check that the plane is indeed alive. However, a better solution is to keep track of the state of the plane in the Damageable component. If the plane has already died, I'll prevent it from calling the "PlaneDestroyed" event twice.

```csharp
if(this.dealh < 0 && !this.dead)
{
    this.dead = true;
    EventManager.TriggerEvent("PlaneDestroyed", (object)this.transform);
}
```

Lastly (for now) we need a simple game over screen. I'll throw together a little UI image and text that are activated when the "GameOver" event is triggered.

# Starting the Game

Before we can implement restarting, we have to actually start first. Now what goes into starting the game? Right now, I basically need to place the planes in different locations. This will require a little change to some code. For example, the `Arena` detects different contestants in `Arena.Start()`. However, if we modify the code to programmatically spawn planes, there won't be any planes when the `Start` method runs.

I also want to be able to *not* spawn planes programmatically if I so choose. For example, when testing new features, it would be nice to not have to start the game randomly and instead set up the scene to my liking. To do this, I could have a component that, when enabled, randomly sets up the game. But when it's disabled, it obviously wouldn't do anything.

This component will be called `Starter`. It'll handle deleting any contestants already in the scene (to allow me to have a scene prebuilt but still allow a randomized start) and adding contestants randomly to the scene. This caused a lot of execution order bugs but I think I have them all worked out. I had to separate the concept of a plane being destroyed and being "unregistered" from the various components that keep track of the number of planes alive. Since I needed to delete the planes that already existed in the scene before spawning new ones, I needed those not to be counted by the `Arena` or `EndGameManager`. However, I didn't want them to register as being destroyed or else the game would think the player had won before it had even started.

To accomplish this, I added a "RegisterContestant" and "UnregisterContestant" event that was separate from the "PlaneDestroyed" event. When a plane is spawned, it registers itself with whatever cares (in my case, the Arena and EndGameManager). When the plane is destroyed, those same components can unregister that plane. However, they can also unregister the plane when the `Starter` deletes all the existing planes in the scene. There were a couple of new bugs introduced by this. For example, the existing planes in the scene would be unregistered before they were even registered, so I had to make a check to be sure the planes had been registered or else the game would start with -4 planes apparently. But, I think I have all the bugs figured out.

```csharp
public void UnregisterContestant(Contestant c)
{
    this.contestants.RemovallAll(contestant => contestant == c);
}

private void Awake()
{
    // Events are separated so that the EndGameManager can know when a plane
    // is being deleted for a different reason other than being destroyed
    EventManager.AddListener("PlaneDestroyed", this.UnregisterContestant);
    EventManager.AddListener("UnregisterContestant", this.UnregisterContestant);
}
```

# Closing the Loop

We have a way to start a game and a way to detect the end of a game. Now we just need a way to restart a game. I already have a prompt to press "R" to restart the game. We just need to wire up that to the `Starter` to know when to spawn new planes. I'll let this live in `EndGameManager` for now.

And that's it for this update. There wasn't much to see on this post, but I'm glad I got a fully functioning (albeit awful) game. My future game plan is split into three steps. First, I want to polish the game I have now to where its fun to play. This means tune up the enemy AI, the plane controller, and add in little polish that makes the game visually pleasing. Then I want to add in the things that make it an actual game - the menus, instructions, etc. By the end of that step it should be a full game that doesn't have much content. Lastly, I want to add content to the game. This means different planes, stats, etc.

The next thing I want to implement is some enemy planes with very basic AI. I don't even think I want to have them shooting bullets yet. My goal is to get them flying around and taking damage from the player. The AI can (and of course will) be updated many times in the future, so I want to get the basics finished.

One of my previous game jam games had enemies roam around the map at random, choosing a new point to go to once they got to their target. I want to follow the same pattern here, except I don't want them to be able to choose a point way across the map. It makes for a lot of long, straight pathing which isn't too exciting. Instead, I want the planes to choose a point near them at random so that hopefully they will sort of zig zag and make lots of turns.

The gif below shows my first attempt at getting enemy movement working. I added a couple of Gizmos that help. First, the two rings show the area that the plane chooses at random from the be the next target. I decided to add an inner ring so that the plane doesn't choose a point right next to it. Then there's a line showing me where the plane's target is. As you can see, things look pretty good! There is an issue where the plan does a full 360 when trying to turn in one direction, so I need to handle that. To control it turning, I used a PD controller where the metric is the angle between the plane's heading and the line to the target. Obviously the goal is for this angle to be zero (i.e. the plane is going towards the target).

The reason the plane is doing a full 360 sometimes is because my code has no notion of which side of the target it is on. Currently, I'm only calculating the angle like below. I need to encode the direction, and I can do this with the dot product between the line to the target and `transform.right`. If this dot product is positive, it means out right side is facing towards the target, so we need to turn right. If it is negative, our right side is facing away from the target, so we need to turn left.

```csharp
float angleToTarget = Vector3.Angle(this.transform.up, this.targetPos - this.transform.position);
```

By adding the dot product to determine direction, the plane was turning correctly. Next came fixing the fact that the plane turns way too fast. This was simple, the PD factor was exceeding -1 or 1, whereas for the player, those are the limits. Slapping the PD factor inside a clamp between -1 and 1 got the plane turning perfectly.

Well, almost. There was an issue with the plane turning so slowly that it couldn't reach its target. I could try and fix this by detecting when the plane passes a tangent line or something to the target, but let's keep this simple. I'm just going to increase the range that the plane considers it is "at" the target and hope that it can't get in this state again. I'm also going to increase the minimum distance to choose a new target so the plane doesn't have to do any sharp turns.

With those changes implemented, the AI pathing looks alright! Now obviously this isn't going to be the final movement, but it's a start. I want to add smarter movement, like following other planes or trying evasive maneuvers. Also, the AI right now turns as quickly as possible to reach its target, and I think this isn't too realistic. But, that's for a later day.

Next I want to get the player to be able to shoot these planes. Since collisions wouldn't really make sense for this game, the planes are going to be able to pass "through," or, more canonically, above/below one another. Therefore I don't want to be able to shoot a plane that is right in front of me because that plane would technically be above or below me. To accomplish this, I think I'll have an "immunity" time that prevents bullets from causing damage for the first portion of this flight. Another way to do this is to have the bullet know which plane fired it, and then do a distance check between the plane being shot and the firing plane. If the distance is too short, then nothing happens. That was my first idea, but the immunity timer sounds easier, so I'll start with that.

The GIF below shows the enemy planes taking damage. There are a couple neat things that I did here that I haven't done before. First, I used events with my `EventManager` class to handle getting shot and dying. When a plane is shot, it has a `Damageable` component that fires the a `Damage` event. Then, the health bar listens for that event and changes itself accordingly. Next, the `Damageable` component fires a `Dead` event when it runs out of health. This is listened for by the plane's AI class and causes the plane to destroy itself. All these events are handled through the global `EventManager`, so I needed a way to distinguish different `Damage` and `Dead` events for different planes. I did a little hacky solution for this - I append the name of the plane onto the end of the event. So, the event names are `Damage_Plane` and `Dead_Plane (2)` because of Unity's default naming convention.

I really like using events, especially for updating the health bar UI, but I don't particularly like how the events are named. Another solution I thought about was having each plane have its own mini `EventManager` that handles only the `Dead` and `Damage` events. However, I decided against this just because other things may want to hook into those events. For example, I could have a counter that tracks how many planes are still alive that would hook into the `Dead` events. Or something like that. Of course, I'm always iterating, so if this way becomes difficult to maintain I can always switch.

And that's it for this update! Next I want to work on getting more of a game loop going with a goal of having a functioning dogfight. This means I'll have to implement the area boundaries, more intelligent pathing, enemy weapons, and player health.

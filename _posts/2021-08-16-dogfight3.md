Like I said at the end of the last post, I want to get a complete game loop finished in this update. This means I have a few things I need to work on:
 * Arena boundaries
 * Enemy weapons
 * Better enemy pathing
 * Player health

So let's get started!

# Arena Boundaries

I want the dogfights to feel like you're in the open sky, but obviously I can't have the player (or an enemy) simply run away. Therefore, I need some sort of boundary, but preferably a "soft" boundary. My current idea is to have two circles: the inner circle starts a "warning, you're approaching the edge of the area," and the outer circle kills you when you pass it. I think some games use a time limit where you have 10 or so seconds outside the boundary. That is a little more complicated than using the two circiles, but it may be better. I'll start with the two circles and see how it goes.

There's a few ways going around my head about how to accomplish this, but I'll stick with the dead simple easiest way. I've learned that the more I try and do something optimized or abstracted, the less motivation I have on the project in the future. My goal for this project is to just get it done, plain and simple. So I am going to do the easiest way to do everything and refactor/optimize if it becomes an issue.

And on that note, I think I'll have an arena `GameObject` that maintains a list of all planes. Then, every `Update`, it will check the distance of the plane to the center of the arena. At the beginning of the dogfight, I can do a search for all instances of a component that are only present on planes, like `Damageable`. If I happen to spawn planes during a dogfight, I could use the `EventManager`. However, I can't use the `EventManager` at the start because there's no order in which game objects are created, so I can't guarentee the arena is created before a plane. I mean I could with an attribute, but that seems hacky. So we'll stick with a global search.

With a couple of Gizmos, we have an arena up and running. The real work doesn't start until we integrate it with the rest of the systems.

# Enemy AI

Before I implement any more AI features, I need to do some refactoring. Take the AI plane component for example. First, it picks a new target location when it reaches the old one. Then, it uses PID to determine how much it wants to turn. Lastly, it moves the plane forward and turns it according to what the PID wants. I want to split this out into several smaller components. A navigator can handle picking a new target and detecting when its at the old one. A PID component can handle all that computation. Lastly, a movement component can handle moving forward and turning. This has the added benefit of me being able to use these for the player if I want to (for example the movement component could be reused).

Oh, and I've decided against using global events for any events that are going between game objects in the same hierarchy. For example, the HealthBar and Damageable component pass events to each other, but they are all in the same plane. I can wire up their events in the plane prefab and never have to worry about it. This means my events don't need hacky names like `Damage_Plane (1)` From now on I'll use the global event system to pass events between different hiearchies.

Now if you look at the smaller components, they are much easier to understand and add more functionality to in the future. The `Navigator` class is now simple since it only has to focus on one specific task.

```csharp
public class Navigator : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private float minTargetDist= 4f;
    [SerializeField] private float maxTargetDist = 10f;

    [SerializeField] private float arrivalDist = 4f;
    [SerializeField] private UnityEvent<Vector3> onArrival

    private Vector3 targetPos;

    private void Start()
    {
        this.ChooseTargetPosition();
    }

    private void Update()
    {
        if (Vector3.Distance(this.transform.position, this.targetPos) < this.arrivalDist)
        {
            this.ChooseTargetPosition();
        }
    }

    private void ChooseTargetPosition()
    {
        float angle = Random.Range(0f, 360f);
        float dist = Random.Range(this.minTargetDist, this.maxTargetDist);

        this.targetPos = this.transform.position + Quaternion.AngleAxis(angle, Vector3.forward) * this.transform.up * dist;
        this.onArrival.Invoke(this.targetPos);
    }
}
```

Now it's time to hook up the ability for the arena to warn planes that they are approaching the boundary. I've thought about how to do this, like maybe the arena passes a message to a Navigator, but that would require the player to have a Navigator, etc. Instead, I'm going to make a new component whose sole purpose is to receive messages from the arena: the Contestant. Then the Contestant component will expose an event that other components can hook into within each plane's hierarchy.

The plane AI should be smart enough to know to stay away from the boundaries, so I'm going to update the Navigator to check if a target position is inside the safe area before assigning it. This means that the Arena will have a static instance (which, you know, there's only one of it so it makes sense).

However, this doesn't always mean that a plane will stay inside the safe area. For example, a plane could do a wide turn into the warning area. When this happens, I could force the plane to choose a point closer to the center of the arena to force them back. However, from testing it for a few minutes, I never saw a case where the plane actually does fly into the kill zone. If it does happen, I'll deal with it, but for now, I'm going to let it be.

Eventually we'll have warnings for the player when they are in the warning zone, but I'll save that for later.

# Enemy Weapons/Player Health

We can deal with the player health part easily - just slap a Damageable component on the player and boom! We have a player with health. To add weapons to the enemies, we'll do a little bit more refactoring. The weapon component right now is hardcoded for the player because it detects a `Fire` key press. I'll move that into the PlayerInput class to make the Weapon component able to be used for both AI and player controlled planes.

Next we need to figure out how to tell the AI planes to fire. To start it would be good to detect when another plane is in front of them. For starters, I'll define an area in front of the plane that detects if there is an enemy, and if so, it'll fire. The shape that makes sense is a sort of circle section defined by an angle and an inner/outer radius, as shown below. On a side note, making all these strange Gizmos is pretty fun!

Making Gizmos is one thing, but actually making the AI detect a plane in that area is another thing. To do this, I'll do a detection circle centered on the plane for all enemies within the outer radius. Then I'll loop through each detected enemy and manually check if they are within the angles and distances.

```csharp
var colliders = Physics2D.OverlapCircleAll(this.transform.position, this.maxTargetingDist, this.layerMask);

for(int i = 0; i < colliders.Length; i++)
{
    var dist = Vector3.Distance(colliders[i].transform.position, this.transform.position);
    var angle = Vector3.Angle(this.transform.up, colliders[i].transform.position - this.transform.position);

    if(dist > this.minTargetingDist && dist < this.maxTargetingDist && angle > this.targetingAngle)
    {
        return true;
    }

}

return false;
```

And that's the end of this recap. Right now we have a very basic game loop that will need a bunch of iteration on it. For the next update, I want to close the game loop - starting the game properly and detecting when it is over.

For the first game I am making, I thought I would try and make a game about airplane dogfighting. My idea is pretty basic, just flying an airplane around and trying to shoot down others. If you've ever played Sly Cooper 3, imagine the Red Baron level (without all the sabotaging of course).

This first post is going to be pretty simple. My goal is to get an airplane flying around that can shoot. To start, though, I'm going to make a basic map for our little playne to fly around on. The assetes that I'll be using (and the one that inspired this game) are the [Pixel Shmup](https://kenney.nl/assets/pixel-shmup) assets from Kenney. Using Unity's tilemap feature, I was able to quickly creating a decent looking map. One that is viable for first testing, at least.

With the tilemap created, it's onto the plane. The movement code is very easy. Since a plane must keep travelling to fly, I just force it to move forward. In the future maybe I'll add the ability to slow down or speed up, but for now one speed is fine. Because of the way Unity 2D's directions are, I had to use `transform.up` for the forward direction and `Vector3.forward` for the up direction. In the below code snippet, `desiredTurn` is simply getting the raw input during `Update` (this code is in `FixedUpdate`).

```csharp
this.transform.position = this.transform.position + this.transform.up * Time.deltaTime * this.forwardSpeed;
this.transform.Rotate(Vector3.forward * this.turnSpeed * -1f * this.desiredTurn;
```

I had to take care of where to pivot the plane around when turning. Since the engine is in the front of my planes, they should also pivot around the front as well. I did this by simply moving the plane sprite back a little bit from the parent object until the center of the parent object was situated at the engine of the plane. Below you can see a comparison of the two setups. It's a subtle difference, but you can definitely tell the incorrect pivot has too tight of a turning radius. In fact, the radius could probably be increased even more.

Now the last thing to do is to add in shooting. This will be changed many times, so I'm not going to spend much time on it. After making a simple bullet prefab, making the plane shoot them is a simple task. To prevent spamming, I added a delay between each bullet being shot. Eventually I'll add in different ways to fire (alternating vs. same time) and ammo limits, but today is not that day.

Before I finished up, I added two more systems just for fun. I always add audio as an afterthought, so for this project I wanted to incorporate audio from day 1. I added a simple plane sound and a placeholder shooting sound (that's currently lasers because that's all I have). The architecture will certainly change, but for the ambient plane noises I have audio sources on the plane itself. For the shooting sounds, I've added an `AudioManager` class that can play any audio clip that happens because of an event. And since it needs events, I also added an `EventManager` class that handles subscribing and firing events. Both of these are modelled after [this blog post](https://minapecheux.com/website/2021/05/14/rts-interlude-2-refactoring-the-event-system-unity-c/) from Mina PÃªcheux.

In all my previous Unity projects, I've tried to abide by a rule that `Monobehaviours` are supposed to be the "view" in a MVC-style architecture. I never wanted to include "managers" on a `GameObject` if they weren't actually in the scene. However, now I have a "just get it done" mentality. If something needs refactored, I'll refactor it. But for now, I want thigns to be as simple as possible. There is no need to optimize or over-architize (defintely not a word but whatever) at the start.

And that's all for this first post! Next, I want to implement other planes for out player to shoot at. I'll probably keep it simple and make them target practice (i.e. not shoot back) for now, but we'll see.

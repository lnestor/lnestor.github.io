For this update, I want to really focus on the plane controller. Right now, I don't think it really *feels* like you're controlling a plane. The turning is just a little off. Included in this will be creating a better weapon mechanic. By the end of this update, the planes should be good to go.

# Forward Motion

I know I specifically mentioned turning, but I am going to make a little tweak to the forward motion of the planes. Right now, each plane moves at a set speed. Instead, I want them to be able to vary between two different speeds. This allows the player to slow down if they want to follow an enemy or speed up to escape an encounter. The actual change isn't very hard - just detcting the input and clamping the speed between the two values. However, I want to take this opportunity to make a class that I think would be super useful - a `Range`. There are so many times that I have a minimum and maximum value, and being able to combine them into one field would just be so clean. Also, it sounds fun to make so let's do it!

The actual `Range` class is pretty simple. We just need a min and max value. I'll use properties with private fields backing them so that I can still serialize the fields but keep the API consistent with the rest of Unity of using properties.

```csharp
[Serializeable]
public class Range
{
    [SerializeField] private float min;
    [SerializeField] private float max;

    public float Min
    {
        get
        {
            return this.min;
        }
        set
        {
            this.min = value;
        }
    }

    public float Max
    {
        get
        {
            return this.max;
        }
        set
        {
            this.max = value;
        }
    }
}
```

We can also add some useful helper functions to this too as we need. One that I can think of off the top of my head is getting a random value between the min and max.

```csharp
public float Random()
{
    return UnityEngine.Random.Range(this.Min, this.Max);
}
```

One of the main reasons for making this class is so I can make a custom property drawer for it. A class with two serialized floats would normally have the properties stacked on top of one another. I want the Range class to have the min and max horizontally in the same line to look nice and clean.

I've never made a custom property drawer, but I've done a few custom editors. Basically, my code won't be good is what I'm trying to say. Using the API documentation as an example, I came up with the below code to start with.

```csharp
[CustomPropertyDrawer(typeof(Range))]
public class RangeUIE : PropertyDrawer
{
    public override void OnGUI(Rect position, SerializedProperty property, GUIContent label)
    {
        EditorGUI.BeginProperty(position, label, property);

        position = EditorGUI.PrefixLabel(position, GUIUtility.GetControlID(FocusType.Passive), label);

        var minRect = new rect(position.x, position.y, position.width / 2, position.height);
        var minRect = new rect(position.x + position.width / 2, position.y, position.width / 2, position.height);

        var minProp = property.FindPropertyRelative("min");
        var maxProp = property.FindPropertyRelative("max");

        EditorGUI.PropertyField(minRect, minProp);
        EditorGUI.PropertyField(maxRect, maxProp);

        EditorGUI.EndProperty()
    }
}
```

This was a little confusing when I first started, so I'll try and go over it. `EditorGUI.PrefixLabel` creates the label of the property name. If I defined a range as `Range myRange`, it would create "MyRange" as a label. It then returns the position where the start of the actual editable information will go. If you look at the `Targeter` image above, the "Targeting Angle" area on the left side is created by `EditorGUI.PrefixLabel`, and it returns the new position where the start of the box containing 15 is. I then create the `Rect`s where the editable area will be, defaulting to half the width of the remaining area. then I call `EditorGUI.PropertyField` which looks at what type of variable it is and makes the correct field, in this case a float box.

However, the image below is what it made. You can see that this doesn't look correct. It took me awhile to figure it out, but it's because the label itself (Min or Max in thise case) has a default width that is wider than I thought. If you see how much space "Range" takes up, that is what the default width is. I have to change this width to somthing smaller to allow everything to fit on the screen.

![Properties with too wide of labels](/assets/images/2021-08-19-dogfight5/range_drawer_incorrect_label_space.png)

```csharp
[CustomPropertyDrawer(typeof(Range))]
public class RangeUIE : PropertyDrawer
{
    public override void OnGUI(Rect position, SerializedProperty property, GUIContent label)
    {
        EditorGUI.BeginProperty(position, label, property);

        position = EditorGUI.PrefixLabel(position, GUIUtility.GetControlID(FocusType.Passive), label);

        var minRect = new rect(position.x, position.y, position.width / 2, position.height);
        var minRect = new rect(position.x + position.width / 2, position.y, position.width / 2, position.height);

        var minProp = property.FindPropertyRelative("min");
        var maxProp = property.FindPropertyRelative("max");

        var originalWidth = EditorGUIUtility.labelWidth;
        EditorGUIUtility.labelWidth = 30f;

        EditorGUI.PropertyField(minRect, minProp);
        EditorGUI.PropertyField(maxRect, maxProp);

        EditorGUIUtility.labelWidth = originalWidth;

        EditorGUI.EndProperty()
    }
}
```

Lastly, I wanted to make this property drawer as robust as possible. And to me, that means giving the user a warning when their minimum value is larger than their maximum value. Maybe there's a use case where I would want this, but I can't think of it now. The only trick with adding in the warning is that I need to adjust the height of the property if the warning appears. At first I didn't adjust the height, and the warning appeared on top of the min and max fields. To change the height, I just needed to override `GetPropertyHeight`. If the min was greater than the max, I returned twice the normal height.

That was a lot for just a simple Range class, but it was fun implementing it. I always like creating generic utility classes that are useful. I really want to make a serializeable dictionary since Unity doesn't serialize dictionaries, but that is for another day. For now, we'll get back to adjusting the forward motion of the plane. We'll need to define an acceleration that determines how quickly the plane can go from min speed to max speed. Then we can lerp the speed between the two.

```csharp
public class PlaneMovement : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private Range speedRange;
    [SerializeField, Range(0, 1)] private float accelNorm;

    ...

    private float speedT = 1f;

    private void Update()
    {
        this.speedT = Mathf.Clamp01(this.speedT + this.accelNorm * Time.deltaTime * this.input.GetY())
    }

    private void FixedUpdate()
    {
        var speed = this.speedRange.Lerp(this.speedT):
        this.transform.position = this.transform.position + this.transform.up * Time.deltaTime * speed;
    }
}
```

I've removed the turning code for brevity, but you can see how we lerp using the `speedT` variable to determine our forward velocity. The GIF below shows this in action.

# Turning

The turning right now feels a little off. I had the pivot point in front of the plane, thinking that would make it feel more realistic. Instead, it feels more realistic when the pivot is around the wings (which might make sense since those are what causes the turn). Perhaps it would be most realistic if the sprite changes to indicate it is turning, but I don't really have the ability to do that right now.

# Weapon Fire

The gun system needs to be flexible enough to handle many different styles of shooting. The plane assets I have contain anywhere from 1 to 4 guns each. I want it to be able to handle shooting all at once, alternating, etc. as well as varying speeds/damage. Ideally it would also be agnostic to the plane itself too, allowing me to slab the code into a scriptable object. That would make upgrades easier. For example, upgrading the speed of your weapon could mean using a new scriptable object or something. That's far in the future though.

For now, I'll label the weapons into different groups. Each plane will have at most 2 groups. The guns in a group will fire all at once. I don't expect to want to fire 4 guns all at different times, so 2 groups should work. then I can define an enum to see if the groups should alternate or fire all at once.

![All groups shooting at once](/assets/images/2021-08-19-dogfight5/single_shot.gif) ![Groups alternating shooting](/assets/images/2021-08-19-dogfight5/alternating_shot.gif)

Lastly, I think it would be nice to add some randomness to shooting. If I added a slightly angle perturbation, it would make the game more realistic. Something like 3 or 4 degrees to each bullet.

And that's just about it for this update. Next I'll be looking into making the enemy planes have a better AI.
